# First_PowerBI_Dashboard
This is my first Power BI Dashboard that I've created for an imaginary sales company named Vincent Corp

The Dashboard contains Visual cards, a Pie chart, a Line chart,a table, a Coloumn chart, and a Map showcasing amount of sales by country. 

* File attached will work on Microsoft Power BI Desktop.
